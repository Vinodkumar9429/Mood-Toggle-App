# Mood Toggle App

This app implements concepts like components, props, state, children props, conditional rendering.

I've created a state for mood,
I used if else block to set Mood conditionally,
Passed children props to Mood component
I've created a seperate component for setting mood.

This app to created to reinforce these topics.
